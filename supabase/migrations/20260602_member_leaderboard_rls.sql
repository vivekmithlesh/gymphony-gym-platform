-- =============================================================================
-- Member Leaderboard — let a member READ their gym-mates (and their workout
-- logs) so the gym-scoped leaderboard can rank everyone in the same gym.
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- These are ADDITIVE select policies. We intentionally do NOT call
-- `enable row level security` here: if RLS is already on, owners keep their
-- existing policies and members gain same-gym read; if RLS is off, these
-- policies are simply inert and existing reads keep working. Either way this
-- migration cannot lock anyone out.
-- =============================================================================

-- Helper: the caller's gym_id, resolved with SECURITY DEFINER so it bypasses
-- RLS on members/profiles. This avoids the infinite-recursion trap you hit when
-- a policy ON members has to SELECT FROM members to find the caller's gym.
